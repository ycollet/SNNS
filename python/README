This is a Python module that provides the SNNS kernel functions.
This should allow much better scripting than batchman and could be a
first step towards a replacement GUI (for example using Tkinter).

Please notice that this is not very well tested, I'd be happy if you
reported problems with it.

For usage, please have a look at the files in the "examples" directory and
read the PyDoc documentation.

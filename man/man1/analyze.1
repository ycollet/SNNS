.SH NAME

.B analyze
\- analyzes result files generated by the neural network simulation package SNNS

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B analyze
[-w] [-r] [-u] [-a] [-S "
.I t c "
] [-v] [-s] [-c] [-m] 
.RI "[ -i " filename "] [ -o " filename "] [-e " function 
.RI "] [ -l " lower-bound " ] [-h " upper-bound " ]" 

.SH OPTIONS
.B -w
.RS
print number of patterns which were classified wrong. (default)
.RE

.B -r
.RS
print number of patterns which were classified correctly.
.RE

.B -u
.RS
print number of patterns which were not classified.
.RE

.B -a
.RS
same as '-w -r -u'
.RE

.B -S 
"
.I t c 
"
.RS
specific: numbers of patterns of class 
.IR t " which are classified as class " c " are printed (-1 = noclass) "
.RE

.B -v
.RS
verbose output. Each printed number is preceded by one of the words
"wrong", "right", "unknown", or "specific" depending on the result of
the classification. 
.RE

.B -s
.RS
statistic information containing wrong, right and not classified
patterns. The network error is printed also. 
.RE

.B -c
.RS
.RB "same as " -s ", but statistics for each output unit (class) is displayed."
.RE

.B -m
.RS
show confusion matrix (only works with -e 402040 or -e WTA)
.RE

.BI -i " filename"
.RS 
name of the 'result file' which is going to be analyzed. Without this
option file is read from stdin.   
.RE

.BI -o " filename"
.RS
name of the file which is going to be produced by 
.B analyze. 
Default is stdout.
.RE

.BI -e " function"
.RS
defines the name of the 'analyzing function' to be used.
.IR function " can be one of the following:"

.B 402040
.RS 
The '402040' rule. That means on a range from 0 to 1 
.B h 
will be 0.6 (upper 40%) and 
.B l
will be 0.4 (lower 40%). The middle 20% is represented by 
.B h - l. 
The classification of the patterns will depend on the values of 
.BR h , " l,"
and other constrains.
.RE

.B WTA
.RS
Winner takes all. That means the classification depends on the unit
with the highest output, on the values of 
.BR h , " l,"
and other constrains. 
.RE

.B band 
.RS
An analyzing function that checks a band of values around the teaching
output. The classification of the patterns will depend on the values of 
.BR h , " l,"
and other constrains.
.RE
.RE

.BI -l " lower-bound"
.RS
first parameter of the analyzing function.
.RE

.BI -h " upper-bound"
.RS
second parameter of the analyzing function.
.RE

.SH DESCRIPTION
The purpose of this tool is to analyze the result files that have been
created by SNNS. The result file which you want to analyze has to
contain the 
.B teaching output
and the
.B propagated output 
of the network.
This tool will let you quantify the performance of your network much
better than the mere SSE value obtained during training.

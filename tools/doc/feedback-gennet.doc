               Description of the tool FEEDBACK-GENNET
               =======================================

The program 'feedback-gennet' generates network definition files for
fully recurrent networks of any size. This is not possible using bignet. 

The networks have the following structure:

  - input layer with no intra layer connections
  - fully recurrent hidden layer
  - output layer: connections from each hidden unit to each output unit AND
    OPTIONALLY fully recurrent intra layer connections in the output layer AND
    OPTIONALLY feedback connections from each output unit to each hidden unit

The activation function of the output units can be set to sigmoidal or linear.
All weights are initialized with 0.0 . Other initializations should be
performed by the init functions in SNNS.

feedback-gennet

Examples:
---------

Generate a network with 3 input units, 3 hidden units connected to
each input unit, each hidden unit and itself, and 1 output unit
with sigmoid activation function connected to each hidden unit.

                  ====================================
                  Description of the tool CONVERT2SNNS
                  ====================================

 In order to work with the KOHONEN tools in SNNS you need a pattern file
 and a network file with a special format.
 Convert2snns will accomplish three important things: 

 - Creation of a 2-dimensional Kohonen Feature Map with n Components
 - Weightfiles are converted in a SNNS compatible .net file
 - A file with raw patterns is converted in a .pat file

 When working with convert2snns, you need 3 files 

 1) A control file, containing the configuration of the network
 2) A file with weight vectors
 3) A file with raw patterns
 
 ***** setup of a control file *****
 
 Each line of the controlfile begins with a KEYWORD followed by the
 respective declaration. The succession of KEYWORDS is arbitrary.

 Example of a control file:

 PATTERNFILE                 eddy.in     ** 
 WEIGHTFILE                  eddy.dat    
 XSIZE                       18          <-
 YSIZE                       18          <-
 COMPONENTS                  8           <-
 PATTERNS                    47          **

 For the creation of a .net file you need at least the statements marked <-
 and for the .pat file additionally the statements marked **!
 Omitting the WEIGHTFILE will initialize the weights of the network with 0.

 See cube.cont for an example of a control file.


 ***** structure of a WEIGHTFILE *****
 
 The WEIGHTFILE is a simple ASCII file, containing the weight vectors row
 by row. Besides, each vector is stored component by component.

 
 ***** structure of a PATTERNFILE *****

 The PATTERNFILE contains in each line the components of a pattern.

 
 When convert2snns has finished the conversion it will ask for the
 name of the NETWORK and PATTERNS to be saved.
 Example:     cube        cube    (without suffix!), 
 resulting in cube.net and cube.pat

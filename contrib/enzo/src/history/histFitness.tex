The modul {\it histFitness} writes all fitness informations of a net in a 
special file (extension {\it .fit}).
Each line of the file accords to one net. 


The file with the {\it .popfit} extension contains informations about the 
fitness of whole population. 
Each line describes the several fitness values (best fitness of all members, 
worst fitness of all members and the average fitness) of the population 
at each generation.  The population file is ready for gnuplot and other
programs.

The fitness values are not computed in this modul, they are computed during 
the {\it evalution} functions and stored in special slots of the 
data structure.

\begin{moduledoc}{Saving all informations about the networks on the cross validation patterns}{histCross}

\item[\KeyWord{historyFile} \Param{filename}]~\\
This string contains the prefix of the filename where all informations are stored.
The extension of the filename is {\it .cross} for the network informations and
{\it .popcross} for the population informations.
\end{moduledoc}

The modul {\it histCross} writes all informations about the network in a special file 
(extension {\it .cross})
Each line of the file accords to one network. It contains information about the number 
of hits (the network classified the pattern correct), miss (the network cassified the pattern wrong)
and nones (the network did not classify the pattern in an unique way). 
It also contains the quotient  hits and misses.

The file with the {\it .popcross} extension contains informations about the whole 
population. Each line describes the several test values (best quotient of all members, 
worst quotient of all members and the average quotient) of the population 
at each generation.  The population file is ready for gnuplot and other
programs.

The values are not computed in this modul, they are computed in the evalution
functions and stored in special slots of the data structure.

This module is only useful in conjunction with  evaluation modules
using classification performance, e.g. {\it bestGuessHigh} or {\it classes}.

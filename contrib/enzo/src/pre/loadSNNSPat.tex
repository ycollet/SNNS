  \item[\KeyWord{learnpattern} \optParam{ x } ]~\\
    This string contains the filename for the learning patterns.\\ 
    Default: - 
  \item[\KeyWord{testpattern} \optParam{ x } ]~\\
    This string contains the filename for the test patterns.
    The test patterns are used to determine the fitness of the networks for the
    genetic algorithm.\\ 
    Default: -
  \item[\KeyWord{crosspattern} \optParam{ x } ]~\\
    This string contains the filename for the validation patterns.
    The validation patterns are used to determine the efficiency of networks.
    These patterns should not be used in the learning phase or to determine
    the fitness of the networks.\\ 
    Default: -

The module {\it loadSNNSPat} loads the three pattern sets with the
original SNNS-function.
The filename must contain the extension {\tt .pat} for the 
SNNS pattern files.
The number of pattern sets to be managed is restricted to 3.
To use more sets you have to increase the maximum number defined in
the population manager.

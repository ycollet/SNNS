\begin{moduledoc}{Random selection of weights}{weightInit}
  \item[\KeyWord{weightProb} \optParam{ x } ]~\\
    This parameter sets the probability $p_{exists}$. Each weight will
    be deleted probability $1 - p_{exists}$.
    Default: 1.0

The module {\it weightInit} deletes weights from a net of the start-population randomly. 
This could by necessary to increase the diversity of the population or to reduce the
free dimensions of the network.

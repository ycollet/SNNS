  \item[\KeyWord{network} \optParam{ x } ]~\\
    This string contains the prefix of the filename, where the networks are  
    stored in.\\ 
    Default: {\tt enzo} 
  \item[\KeyWord{popsize} \optParam{ x } ]~\\
    This parameter $x$ sets the number of networks for the starting population.\\
    Default: {\tt POP\_SIZE\_VALUE} (30)
\end{moduledoc}

The module {\it loadPop} loads networks for the starting population. 
The filename for the reference net consists of the prefix {\it network} and 
the extension {\tt \_ref.net}.
The filename for the other networks consists of the prefix {\it network} 
and an extension containing a number, e.g., \verb+network_0000.net+.
It is important that all  hidden units of the reference net and the
other networks of the starting population get the same unit name in SNNS.
The purpose of this module was to restart an evolution from a stopped
process. The postfix of network names are just in the way \ENZO stored them.

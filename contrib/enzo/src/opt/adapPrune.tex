The module {\it adapPrune} is an adaptive variation of standard pruning.
Weights which are smaller than the threshold are deleted.
The threshold is set individually for every network, depending on the mean value
of its weights. If the factor {\it aveThreshold} is not set the value {\it threshold}
is used. The distribution of possible changes is realized with a Gaussian
distribution $g(x)$ and a maximal factor: \\
\\
\centerline{($\Delta_{threshold} =   g(x) *  $ {\it deltaThreshold}).}

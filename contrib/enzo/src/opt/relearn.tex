\begin{moduledoc}{Relearning}{relearn}

\item[\KeyWord{relearnfactor} \optParam{f}]~\\
The parameter $x$ indicates the factor with which all weights and biases will
be multiplied with. \\
Default: 1.0 (no change of the weights and biases takes place.)

In the mind of {\it lamarckism} not only the topology of the parents will 
be transmitted to the offspring, but also the strength of connections inside the 
structure.
In the case of neural networks this will lead to a local minimum in the learning
function. To escape from this local minimum it is necessary to change the weights a little
bit. The module {\it relearn} multiplies  all weights and biases with a given factor.

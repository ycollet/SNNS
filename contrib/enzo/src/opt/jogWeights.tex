In the mind of {\it lamarckism} not only the topology of the parents will 
be transmitted to the offspring, but also the strength of connections inside the 
structure. To get out of the centre of a local minima 
the module {\it jogWeights} adds  random uniform distributed values to the
connection weights. This is an alternative to the {\it relearn}-module, that multiplies
all weights by a constant factor.

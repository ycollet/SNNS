  \item[\KeyWord{gensize} \optParam{ gen } ]~\\
  This parameter sets the number of networks in the offspring population.\\
   Default: 10
  \item[\KeyWord{preferfactor} \optParam{ x } ]~\\
  This parameter $x$ sets the bias for selecting fitter networks.
  A value $x \ge 1$ means that the better networks will be preferred,   
  a value $0 \le x\le 1$ means that the poor networks.
  A value $x = 2$ means that the first quarter of the population is as
  often selected as the rest of the population.
  A value $x = 3$ means that the first 12.5\% of the population is as
  often selected as the rest of the population.

    Default: 3.0

This  module selects the given number of  parents for the reproduction process
(mutation and crossover).
Better networks are selected with a higher probability.

\item[\KeyWord{crossPattern} \optParam{name}]~\\
Name of the file which contains the set of cross validation patterns.\\
Default: -


\item[\KeyWord{hitRating} \optParam{f}]~\\
Value that is added to the fitness term, in case the network classifies a
pattern correctly.\\
Default: 0.0

\item[\KeyWord{missRating} \optParam{f}]~\\  
Value that is added to the fitness term, in case the network classifies a
pattern wrong.\\
Default: 10.0

\item[\KeyWord{noneRating} \optParam{f}]~\\ 
Value that is added to the fitness term, in case the network doesn't classifies a
pattern.\\
Default: 10.0

\item[\KeyWord{hitThreshold} \optParam{f}]~\\ 
The Value gives the threshold that needs to be reached, before classifying takes place\\
Default: 0.3

\item[\KeyWord{hitDistance} \optParam{f}]~\\ 
The Value gives the distance between the output of two neurons, before a classification
counts as valid.\\
Default: 0.2

The module  {\it bestGuessLow} tests the generalization performance of a network
and increases the fitness.
The neuron is selected which has the lowest activity, e.g., a Looser-takes-all
selection.
 If its activity
distance to the next lowest activated neuron is smaller than {\it hitDistance} 
the pattern is  treated as not classified.

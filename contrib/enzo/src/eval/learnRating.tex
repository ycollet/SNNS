\item[\KeyWord{noLearnRating} \optParam{f}]~\\
This value is added to the fitness term if the network couldn't
learn the patterns properly, e.g. its mean error was higher
than specified by {\it maxtss}\\
Default: 200.0

\item[\KeyWord{epochRating} \optParam{f}]~\\
The number of learning epochs needed is multiplied by this value and added to
the fitness term.\\
Default: 0.0

\item[\KeyWord{tssRating} \optParam{f}]~\\ 
The mean error is multiplied by this value and added to the fitness term.\\
Default: 0.0

\item[\KeyWord{maxtss} \optParam{f}]~\\ 
If the mean error is lower than this value, learning is stopped.
It is necessary to decide if learning was successful or not.\\
Default: 0.5

The module {\it learnRating} evaluates the learning properties of
all offspring networks. It is possible to evaluate the mean error,
the number of training epochs until the mean error is lower
than a given threshold and additionally punish networks which couldn't learn
the patterns with a specified precision.

\item[\KeyWord{weightRating} \optParam{f}]~\\
The number of connections in the network is multiplied by this value and
divided through  the maximal number of connections ( in the reference network).
The result is added
to the fitness term.\\
Default: 0.0

\item[\KeyWord{unitRating} \optParam{u}]~\\  
The number of hidden units in the network is multiplied by this value and
divided through  the maximal number of hidden units ( in the reference network).
The result is added
to the fitness term.\\
Default: 0.0

\item[\KeyWord{inputRating} \optParam{k}]~\\ 
The number of input units in the network is multiplied by this value and
divided through  the maximal number of input units ( in the reference network).
The result is added
to the fitness term.\\
Default: 0.0

The module {\it topologyRating} evaluates the topology of all
offspring networks. Criteria are the number of connections,
the number of hidden units and the number of input units.
These numbers are multiplied by a scaling factor and divided through
the maximal values of the reference network. The result contributes
to the fitness.

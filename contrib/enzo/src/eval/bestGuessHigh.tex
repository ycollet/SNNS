\item[\KeyWord{crossPattern} \optParam{name}]~\\
Name of the file which contains the set of cross validation patterns.\\
Default: -


\item[\KeyWord{hitRating} \optParam{f}]~\\
Value that is added to the fitness term, in case the network classifies a
pattern correctly.\\
Default: 0.0

\item[\KeyWord{missRating} \optParam{f}]~\\  
Value that is added to the fitness term, in case the network classifies a
pattern wrong.\\
Default: 10.0

\item[\KeyWord{noneRating} \optParam{f}]~\\ 
Value that is added to the fitness term, in case the network doesn't classify a
pattern.\\
Default: 10.0

\item[\KeyWord{hitThreshold} \optParam{f}]~\\ 
The value gives the threshold that needs to be reached, before classifying takes place\\
Default: 0.3

\item[\KeyWord{hitDistance} \optParam{f}]~\\ 
The value gives the distance between the output of two neurons, before a classification
counts as valid.
Default: 0.2

The module  {\it bestGuessHigh} tests the generalization performance of a network
and increases the fitness. It is useful for a Winner-takes-all output (1 out of n)
properties. The neuron with the highest activity is selected as winner. If its activity
distance to the next highest activated neuron is smaller than {\it hitDistance} 
the pattern is  treated as not classified.

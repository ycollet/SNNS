\begin{moduledoc}{Crossover of the connections between input- and output layer}{linCross}

\item[\KeyWord{probCross} \optParam{ x } ]~\\
    Probability of inserting a connection, that is contained in only one parent.
    Default: 0.5 
\end{moduledoc}


This module does a linear crossover for all weights, which connect
directly the input layer to the output layer, e.g., in nets without
hidden layers or with shortcut connections.
Only those connections are manipulated in the offspring net, no other
units or weights are involved.
If a network does not contain any of these connections, it remains
unchanged.

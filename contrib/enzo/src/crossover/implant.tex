\item[\KeyWord{implantProb} \optParam{ x } ]~\\
    Probability of selecting a hidden unit of the first hidden layer
	from the best parent network
	and  implanting it in one offspring network.\\
    Default: 0.2 
\end{moduledoc}


This module selects a hidden unit from the first hidden layer
in the fittest parent network
and implants it in an offspring network. The hidden units are
marked with their name to prevent implantation of a feature
twice.

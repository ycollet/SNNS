The XOR-Problem

The XOR-Problem  is solvable by a multi-layer perceptron with
one hidden layer. The minimal topology found also by \ENZO is
2-1-1, with 4 weights using shortcut connections.



If you want to use the X-history output window, use for all benchmarks
the command file with an additional <x> as prefix.

Start the  benchmark with:

	enzo xor.cmd    or    enzo xxor.cmd

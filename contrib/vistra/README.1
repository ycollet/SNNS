VISTRA

Vistra is provided as is. No warranty whatsoever.
There is no English documentation. There is only minimal support.
Vistra was developed on SUN SS2 with SunOS 4.1.2 and DECs with Ultrix 4.2
Vistra needs X11R5.
Vistra compiles with gcc-2.4.5. It does not compile with some older versions.
Vistra expects a widget set from the FWF (Free widget foundation).
If you don't have those widget sets, see README.2 on how to compile
Vistra without those libraries (and hence without a file selector).
The action Transform:PCA expects a program that reads patterns in LVQ format
and writes its result in LVQ format. If there is no such program with
the name pca in your path, Vistra's response is undefined, most likely a
crash.

To compile Vistra, first adapt the Makefile, then say make.
However, there is an executable for Sun (vistra) and DEC (vistra.dec)
included.

To enable Vistra to find the format desciptions you have to set an 
environment variable VISTRAFORMATS to the formats directory of Vistra.
